echo
echo "The UniSentinal code has been updated with multiple API endpoint fallbacks"
echo "for UniFi 9.4.19 compatibility. To test the fix:"
echo
echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ Restart your Docker container:"
echo "   docker restart <container_name>"
echo "   # OR"
echo "   docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d"
echo
echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ Wait for container to start (30 seconds)"
echo
echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ Test the enhanced blocking:"
echo "   curl -s -X POST 'http://192.168.0.74:8003/api/parental/devices/b8:31:b5:1d:8d:e2/block' \\"
echo "     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\"
echo "     -d '{\"reason\":\"api_test\"}'"
echo
echo "4Ô∏è‚É£ Check the detailed logs:"
echo "   curl -s 'http://192.168.0.74:8003/api/logs' | tail -10"
echo
echo "üìã What the updated code does:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Tries 5 different API endpoints in sequence"
echo "‚Ä¢ Tests various command formats (block-sta, block_sta)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Includes Dream Machine specific endpoints"
echo "‚Ä¢ Logs which endpoint works (if any)"
echo
echo "üéØ Expected outcome:"
echo "‚Ä¢ If ANY endpoint works, blocking will succeed"
echo "‚Ä¢ Logs will show which endpoint was successful"
echo "‚Ä¢ If all fail, we'll know the API is completely restricted"

echo
echo "üí° Note: You confirmed manual blocking works, so there MUST be a working API"
echo "The updated code should find it!"
