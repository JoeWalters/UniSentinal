# Enhanced Parental Controls Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented a comprehensive parental controls system similar to Google Family Link that allows you to manage UniFi router devices with blocking, scheduling, and time limit features.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Add Device Functionality
- **Device Selection Modal**: Shows all available devices from your UniFi controller
- **Search Functionality**: Filter devices by name, MAC address, or vendor
- **One-Click Adding**: Add any UniFi device to parental controls management
- **Automatic Refresh**: Updates the parental controls list after adding devices

### 2. Device Management System
- **Comprehensive Management Modal**: Complete device control interface
- **Tabbed Interface**: Organize features into Controls, Schedule, Time Limits, and Activity tabs
- **Real-time Status**: Shows current block status and remaining time

### 3. Blocking Controls
- **Manual Block/Unblock**: Instantly block or unblock devices
- **Temporary Blocking**: Block devices for a specific number of minutes
- **Automatic Unblocking**: Temporary blocks expire automatically

### 4. Schedule Management
- **Weekly Scheduling**: Set different blocked periods for each day of the week
- **Multiple Time Periods**: Add multiple blocked time windows per day
- **Visual Schedule Builder**: Easy-to-use time picker interface
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Perfect for bedtime, homework time, or family time restrictions

### 5. Time Limits
- **Daily Time Limits**: Set maximum usage time per day (similar to Screen Time)
- **Bonus Time**: Add extra time when needed (like Google Family Link)
- **Usage Tracking**: See how much time has been used today
- **Automatic Enforcement**: Devices are blocked when time limit is reached

### 6. Activity Monitoring
- **Activity Logs**: View all parental control actions for each device
- **Detailed History**: See when devices were blocked, unblocked, or limited
- **Reason Tracking**: Understand why actions were taken (schedule, time limit, manual)

### 7. Statistics Dashboard
- **Real-time Stats**: See counts of blocked, scheduled, and time-limited devices
- **Quick Overview**: Instantly understand your parental controls status

## How It Works

### Adding Devices
1. Click "Add Device" on the Parental Controls tab
2. Search through all your UniFi devices
3. Click "Add" next to any device you want to manage
4. Device immediately appears in your managed devices list

### Managing Devices
1. Click "Manage" on any device card
2. Use the tabbed interface to:
   - **Controls**: Block/unblock, temporary blocks, bonus time
   - **Schedule**: Set up recurring time restrictions
   - **Time Limits**: Set daily usage limits
   - **Activity**: View device history

### Scheduling Example
- Block social media devices from 10 PM to 8 AM on school nights
- Allow weekend gaming but block during family dinner (6-7 PM)
- Restrict homework devices during study time

### Time Limits Example
- Set 2 hours per day limit on gaming devices
- Add 30 minutes bonus time for good behavior
- Automatically block when daily limit is reached

## API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/parental/devices/available` - Get all UniFi devices
- `GET /api/parental/devices/managed` - Get managed devices with status
- `POST /api/parental/devices/add` - Add device to parental controls
- `DELETE /api/parental/devices/:mac` - Remove device from parental controls
- `POST /api/parental/devices/:mac/block` - Block device
- `POST /api/parental/devices/:mac/unblock` - Unblock device
- `POST /api/parental/devices/:mac/time-limit` - Set time limits/bonus time
- `POST /api/parental/devices/:mac/schedule` - Set device schedule
- `GET /api/parental/devices/:mac/logs` - Get device activity logs

## User Experience
The interface now provides a complete parental controls solution that's:
- **Intuitive**: Similar to familiar apps like Google Family Link
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all major parental control needs
- **Real-time**: Immediate feedback and status updates
- **Flexible**: Accommodates different family schedules and rules

## Next Steps
The system is now fully functional. You can:
1. Configure your UniFi controller settings
2. Start adding devices to parental controls
3. Set up schedules and time limits as needed
4. Monitor activity through the logs

The parental controls will automatically enforce rules through your UniFi controller, blocking/unblocking devices as configured.
