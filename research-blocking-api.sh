echo "====================================="

echo "Possible reasons for 403 with working manual blocking:"
echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ API endpoint path changed (e.g., /cmd/sta-mgr instead of /cmd/stamgr)"
echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ Command format changed (e.g., 'block_sta' instead of 'block-sta')"
echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ Additional parameters required in 9.4.19"
echo "4Ô∏è‚É£ API requires different authentication method"
echo "5Ô∏è‚É£ Dream Machine uses different endpoints than regular controllers"
echo

echo "üí° Investigation needed:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Check UniFi 9.4.19 API documentation"
echo "‚Ä¢ Compare Dream Machine API vs regular controller API"
echo "‚Ä¢ Test if other management commands work (e.g., forget-sta)"
echo

echo "üîß Temporary workaround options:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Use UniFi's built-in client blocking rules instead of API"
echo "‚Ä¢ Create firewall rules that can be toggled via API"
echo "‚Ä¢ Use VLAN changes instead of device blocking"
echo

echo "üì± Since mobile app works, the question is:"
echo "What API does the mobile app use that's different from /cmd/stamgr?"
